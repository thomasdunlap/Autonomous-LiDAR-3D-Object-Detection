# Autonomous Perception: Tracking 3D-Objects Over Time

** **README IS CURRENTLY A ROUGH DRAFT AND BEING UPDATED DAILY** **

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?


#### Visualize range image channels (ID_S1_EX1)

*Where to find this task?*

This task involves writing code within the function show_range_image located in the file student/objdet_pcl.py.

*What this task is about?*

In the Waymo Open dataset, lidar data is stored as a range image. Therefore, this task is about extracting two of the data channels within the range image, which are "range" and "intensity", and convert the floating-point data to an 8-bit integer value range. Once you have done so, please use the OpenCV library to stack the range and intensity image vertically and visualize it.

A detailed description of all required steps can be found in the code.

#### Visualize lidar point-cloud (ID_S1_EX2)

*Where to find this task?*

This task involves writing code within the function show_pcl located in the file student/objdet_pcl.py.

*What this task is about?*

The goal of this task is to use the Open3D library to display the lidar point-cloud in a 3d viewer in order to develop a feel for the nature of lidar point-clouds. A detailed description of all required steps can be found in the code.

When the code is functional, you are supposed to use the viewer to locate and closely inspect point-clouds on vehicles and write a short report that includes the following items:

    Find and display 6 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud
    Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly. Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the lidar intensity channel.

#### Convert sensor coordinates to BEV-map coordinates (ID_S2_EX1)

Where to find this task?

This task involves writing code within the function bev_from_pcl located in the file student/objdet_pcl.py.


What this task is about?

The goal of this task is to perform the first step in creating a birds-eye view (BEV) perspective of the lidar point-cloud. Based on the (x,y)-coordinates in sensor space, you must compute the respective coordinates within the BEV coordinate space so that in subsequent tasks, the actual BEV map can be filled with lidar data from the point-cloud.

A detailed description of all required steps can be found in the code.

### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 

Up to the point in which more sensors compromise necessary latency of vehicle actions, more sensors and sensor-fusion improves over single-sensor results.  Noise, sensor-failure, and individual sensor weaknesses can be more easily compensated for with additional sensors.

Benefits of camera-lidar fusion over exclusively leveraging lidar data are many.  Point there are certain kinds of reflective surfaces lidar can struggle with - adding camera sensory information can help resolve issues where there is noise in the lidar.  More sensor data is generally helpful up to the threshold where it effects production performance.


### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?

In real-life, dirty data, latency of preprocessing and predicting with live data, camera's being effected or obscured by weather, lidar dealing with surfaces that provide too much noise or non-optimal measurements.  Dealing with the fact that camera images are a 2D project of a 3d world.  The cost of getting the "best" or "fastest" sensors vs. what consumers will purchase.

Object dectection is based on deep learning models that "learn" based on a large number of examples in a dataset.  It is probably impossible to represent every scenario that will every happen while driving - so the battle is getting enough examples of common occurances and putting in enough safety measures so the car to percieve and act safely.


### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?

Yes, having more data.  Going through and checking the annotations to make sure they are correct.

## Key Terms

* Frustum: portion of cone or pyramid that lies between parallel planes
* Voxel: 3D pixel - Volume Element represents unit of 3d space in a grid

## Equations

BEV map properties:
* Height $H_{i,j} = max(P_{i,j} * [0,0,1]T)$
* Intensity $I_{i,j} = max(I(P_{i,j}))$
* Density $D_{i,j} = min(1.0,\ \frac{log(N+1)}{64})$

$P_{i,j}$ is the set of points that falls into each cell, with $i,j$ as the respective cell coordinates. $N_{i,j}$ refers to the number of points in a cell.

Precision and recall:

Precision: $P = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$

Recall: $R = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$

Accuracy: $A = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$


Average Precision: $AP = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{Recall_{i}}Precision(Recall_{i})$

# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking
This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, you'll fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. You will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

<img src="img/img_title_1.jpeg"/>

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm.

Also, the project code contains various tasks, which are detailed step-by-step in the code. More information on the algorithm and on the tasks can be found in the Udacity classroom.

### Cloning the Project
In order to create a local copy of the project, please click on "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you may of-course use GitHub Desktop or Git Bash for this purpose. 

### Python
The project has been written using Python 3.7. Please make sure that your local installation is equal or above this version. 

### Package Requirements
All dependencies required for the project have been listed in the file `requirements.txt`. You may either install them one-by-one using pip or you can use the following command to install them all at once: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

### Waymo Open Dataset Reader
The Waymo Open Dataset Reader is a very convenient toolbox that allows you to access sequences from the Waymo Open Dataset without the need of installing all of the heavy-weight dependencies that come along with the official toolbox. The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset â€“ Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.
